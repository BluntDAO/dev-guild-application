# The Developer Guild

In order for BluntDAO to maintain an open-source development team that continues to build chain-agnostic nft, dao, and defi solutions, we are forming a developer üî∞ guild within the BluntDAO.

  

### The goal of the Blunt Dev Guild is to ü§∫

*   foster open-source and inclusive Web3 solutions
*   build on innovative technologies with a multi-chain methodology
*   focus on DAOs with BluntDAO being the use case for enterprise develping DAO tools for production
